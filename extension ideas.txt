**- Ability to select *ANY* cartoon character as the reference style image - most achievable
- Select more than one cartoon character as the reference style image - changing the cost/loss function and architecture

Requires re-training the model to add these features

One file: 'instyle_code.npy' is not available on the links they shared -> hopefully this isn't too important


add in argument parser to add to second image
specify weights


train on more generic data - on own dataset - actual human beings

collect more data - anime characters

one model for everything --> 

reference style images could be another person

make images look funnier

facial warping

different styles on different sides of the faces
