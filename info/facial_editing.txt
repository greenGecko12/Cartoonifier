the encoder returns a latent code

we can modify the latent code before passing it to the generator

this will modify the cartoon (because the inputted human face is also different)

could possibly add an output in the Gradio UI which allows the user to see the modified human face too.

Note: the boundaries are already normalised

Changing Atrributes are: Smile, Pose, Eyeglasses, Gender (maybe)


Pose: not entangled with anything

Smile: entangled with age and gender (not any more)

Eyeglasses: entangled with gender (only if you go negative)

Gender: entangled with eyeglasses (only if you go too far)

Age: entangled with gender and smile (if you go negative)
